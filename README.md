# This time I have learned to make websites that are dynamic but without using JavaScript.

I have created a simple application using a technology called **Live Wire** and this project is explained how to use Live Wire on simple example like polls.
You can create, delete and vote in polls _without updating page_.

With help the technology I can be able to make dynamic website without JS or frameworks like Vue or React.
